# はじめに

「グーテンベルク」は、2017年のWordPressのエディターで重点的にとりくむためのコードネームです。この重点的な取り組みのゴールは、だれでも簡単にリッチなポストレイアウトを作成できる、投稿と固定ページの新しい編集体験を生み出すことです。以下が最初に決めたゴールです:


> The editor will endeavour to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.

Key take-aways from parsing that paragraph:

- Authoring richly laid out posts is a key strength of WordPress.
- By embracing "the block", we can potentially unify multiple different interfaces into one. Instead of learning how to write shortcodes, custom HTML, or paste URLs to embed, you should do with just learning the block, and all the pieces should fall in place.
- "Mystery meat" refers to hidden features in software, features that you have to discover. WordPress already supports a large number of blocks and 30+ embeds, so let's surface them.

Gutenberg is being developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg), and you can try [an early beta version today from the plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/). Though keep in mind it's not fully functional, feature complete, or production ready.
